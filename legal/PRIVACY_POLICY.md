# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Introduction

TruthPool ("we," "our," or "us") is a decentralized oracle and prediction market protocol built on the Solana blockchain. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

**Wallet Information**: When you connect your Solana wallet to TruthPool, we receive your public wallet address. We do not have access to your private keys, seed phrases, or the ability to control your wallet.

**Transaction Data**: When you participate in prediction markets, submit oracle votes, or stake tokens, these actions are recorded on the public Solana blockchain. This includes:
- Wallet addresses involved in transactions
- Vote commitments and reveals
- Stake amounts and market positions
- Timestamps of on-chain activities

**Bot Configuration**: If you use our miner agent or AMM bot services, configuration preferences you set are stored locally on your device.

### Information Collected Automatically

**Device Information**: We may collect information about your mobile device, including device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.

**Usage Data**: We collect information about how you interact with the Service, including:
- Features used
- Screens viewed
- Time spent on the application
- Crash reports and performance data

**Network Information**: We collect information about your connection to the Solana network, including RPC endpoint usage and transaction status.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide the Service**: Enable wallet connections, process transactions, and facilitate participation in prediction markets and oracle voting
- **Improve the Service**: Analyze usage patterns to enhance user experience and fix bugs
- **Ensure Security**: Monitor for fraudulent activity, abuse, or violations of our Terms of Service
- **Communicate**: Send you important updates about the Service (if you opt in)
- **Comply with Law**: Meet legal obligations and respond to lawful requests

## Blockchain Data

TruthPool operates on the Solana blockchain. Please be aware that:

- **Public Nature**: All transactions on the Solana blockchain are public and permanently recorded. Anyone can view transaction history associated with wallet addresses.
- **Immutability**: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be modified or deleted by us or anyone else.
- **Pseudonymity**: While wallet addresses do not directly reveal your identity, they may be linked to your identity through other means (e.g., exchange KYC records, public disclosures).

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:

**Service Providers**: We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, infrastructure).

**Blockchain Validators**: Transaction data is shared with Solana network validators as part of normal blockchain operations.

**Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.

**Business Transfers**: In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred.

**With Your Consent**: We may share information with your explicit consent.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, including:

- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure key management practices
- Regular security assessments
- Access controls for our systems

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

- **On-Chain Data**: Blockchain data is permanent and cannot be deleted
- **Off-Chain Data**: We retain usage data and analytics for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill the purposes described in this policy
- **Local Data**: Data stored locally on your device (e.g., salt caches, wallet files) remains until you delete it

## Your Rights and Choices

**Wallet Disconnection**: You can disconnect your wallet from TruthPool at any time through the app settings.

**Local Data Deletion**: You can delete locally stored data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the application.

**Opt-Out of Analytics**: You may opt out of analytics collection through your device settings.

**Access and Portability**: You can view your on-chain transaction history using any Solana blockchain explorer.

## Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for users under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have different data protection laws. By using the Service, you consent to such transfers.

## Third-Party Services

The Service may integrate with third-party services, including:

- **Solana Wallets**: Phantom, Solflare, and other Mobile Wallet Adapter compatible wallets
- **RPC Providers**: Solana network access providers
- **Price Oracles**: External data sources for market information

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by:
- Posting the new policy in the app
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Sending a notification through the app (for significant changes)

Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Decentralization Notice

TruthPool is designed as a decentralized protocol. While we develop and maintain the mobile application, the underlying smart contracts operate autonomously on the Solana blockchain. We do not control:

- User funds or wallet access
- Smart contract execution
- Validator node operations
- On-chain governance decisions
